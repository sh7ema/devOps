I have a fireball inside of my head
Draw from the flesh to the bones I dread
And ever when the darkness knows your stride
And I survived let me burn to ground
I have a fireball inside of my head
Draw from the flesh to the bones I dread
And ever when the darkness knows your stride
And I survived let me burn to ground
